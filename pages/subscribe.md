Each week I write for my newsletter. Topics I've covered in the past include habits, creativity, health/fitness, meditation, spirituality and technology.

I try to say something that will be meaningful and stand the test of time. You won't often see me comment on the latest news headlines. Instead, I'll talk about how to build a rich and meaningful life.

I'm a creator. I'm a huge fan of the Internet, even with all its many failings. I believe in compassion and trying to make a difference.

If those sound like things you're into as well, consider getting my articles in your inbox. Your email is private, and I will never send you spam. I take your trust seriously.
