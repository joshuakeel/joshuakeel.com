Life is weird.

It&#8217;s confusing, baffling, and mind-blowing. There&#8217;s no guidebook for being human. You don&#8217;t hand a three year old the _Owner&#8217;s Manual_ and say here you go, kid. We&#8217;re all just doing the best we can with what we&#8217;ve been given, but there are better and worse ways to navigate ourselves in this world. My mission is to find the best ways, and to share them with you.

What does it mean to live a good life? What is our place in this universe? I&#8217;m interested in both the big questions of science and philosophy, as well as the best way to plan your day and get stuff done. Whatever can make us healthier, happier and easier to get along with, I want to find it and talk about it.
