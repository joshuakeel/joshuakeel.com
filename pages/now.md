I’m at home (and plan to stay that way), in Raleigh, NC, focusing on:

* Trying to survive this pandemic without completely losing my sanity.
* Reading _Wish Lanterns: Young Lives in New China_, an excellent book about Chinese millennials.
* Trying out [Strength Side Guided](https://www.strengthsideguided.com/) to become more flexible and strong.
* Working on becoming an expert in the Angular web development framework, and leading a project using it at work.
* Cooking more (egg rolls tonight).
* Writing and publishing weekly articles for my [newsletter](/subscribe/) and this website.
