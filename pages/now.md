title: What I’m Doing Now
permalink: now/index.html

I’m currently at home in Raleigh, NC. In no particular order, these are the things I'm doing and thinking about:

* Working out 3 times a week, and trying to be active (e.g. take a walk) on "off" days.
* Creating more space in my life to think and strategize, rather than just react and get caught up in whatever life throws at me.
* Exploring what my long-term goals and ambitions are.
* Listening to a lot of funny sci-fi and fantasy (John Scalzi, Terry Pratchett).
* Planning travel for when my wife and I are fully inoculated against COVID-19.
