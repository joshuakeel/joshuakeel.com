title: What I’m Doing Now
permalink: now/index.html

I’m at home, in Raleigh, NC, focusing on:

* Writing and publishing weekly articles for my [newsletter](/subscribe/).
* Working my way through my to-read stack. I just finished Nir Eyal's _Indistractable_, and now I'm reading Megan Phelps-Roper's _Unfollow_.
* Getting excited about static site generators (like [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), which runs this site) and the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/).
* Creating better habits using the principles of [tiny habits](/your-best-habit-strategy-depends-on-your-motivation-level/) and habit tracking.
