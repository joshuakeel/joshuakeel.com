I’m at home (and plan to stay that way), in Raleigh, NC, focusing on:

* Listening to Stephen Fry read _The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_.
* Working out three days a week in my [home gym](https://joshuakeel.com/the-joys-of-a-home-gym/).
* Social distancing aka staying home with my wife.
* Watching lots of Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime and HBO Now to get through this pandemic.
* Working on becoming an expert in the Angular web development framework, and leading a project using it at work. I'm attending a virtual Angular conference called [ng-conf: Hardwired](https://www.ng-conf.org/) next week.
* Cooking more.
* Writing and publishing weekly articles for my [newsletter](/subscribe/) and this website.
