title: What I’m Doing Now
permalink: now/index.html

I’m at home, in Raleigh, NC, focusing on:

* Writing and publishing weekly articles for my [newsletter](/subscribe/).
* Working my way through my to-read stack. I just finished Megan Phelps-Roper's wonderful memoir _Unfollow_, and now I'm reading _Measure What Matters_ by John Doerr.
* Creating better habits using the principles of [tiny habits](/your-best-habit-strategy-depends-on-your-motivation-level/) and habit tracking. I'm specifically rebuilding my habits of eating three to four meals per day without snacking, and doing some form of physical activity each day (walking and strength training, mostly).
