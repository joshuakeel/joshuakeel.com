I&#8217;m in Raleigh, NC, focusing on:

  * Writing my [weekly newsletter][1].
  * Creating as many new articles as I can here and on [Medium][2].
  * Reading Scott H. Young&#8217;s book [_Ultralearning_][3]. I [wrote about it][4] as well.
  * My day job as a full-stack software developer for a non-profit.
