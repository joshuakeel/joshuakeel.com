title: What I’m Doing Now
permalink: now/index.html

I’m at home, in Raleigh, NC. At present, my focus is on:

* Writing articles for my [weekly newsletter](/subscribe/), that also get posted here, and sometimes on Medium.
* Spending time with family and friends.
* Watching movies from time to time at Alamo Drafthouse, where I have a season pass.
* Trying to make it through my to-read stack. Currently I'm working my way through Nir Eyal's _Indistractible_.
* My work as a full-stack software developer at an energy sector non-profit.
