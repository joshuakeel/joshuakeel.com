I&#8217;m at home, in Raleigh, NC. At present, my focus is on:

  * Writing articles for my [weekly newsletter][1], that also get posted here, and sometimes on Medium.
  * Spending time with family and friends.
  * Watching movies from time to time at Alamo Drafthouse, where I have a season pass.
  * Trying to make it through my to-read stack. Currently I'm working my way through Nir Eyal's _Indistractible_.
  * My work as a full-stack software developer at an energy sector non-profit.
