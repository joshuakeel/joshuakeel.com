I promised this update on Sunday, and here it is, Tuesday, and I&#8217;m just now sitting down to write it. Apparently I still have a lot to learn about [keeping my word][1]. But mostly I think I was ashamed to write this, because here&#8217;s the painful truth: I fell flat on my face more than once in the last week.

For the first day or so, everything was fine. I felt pretty hungry in the morning, but I&#8217;m tough, I could handle it. I thought if I could just make it through the first few days, maybe a couple of weeks, I&#8217;d adjust and it would become easier. Unfortunately, we never got to find out. The hunger became more and more intense, especially at night, for some reason. I&#8217;m having trouble remembering which, but on either Tuesday or Wednesday night of this last week, I was almost out of my mind with desire for food. I just wanted to gobble everything in sight.

Let me tell you, this was kind of scary for me. This is my binge mode. This is what I used to do almost every day, and was a large part of how I became obese. I felt like I was losing my grip. I didn&#8217;t completely let myself go (I ended up eating at maintenance calories or slightly above, instead of in the deficit I was aiming for), but I was pretty surprised and disoriented by the experience.

The next day I decided I would just pick myself back up and start again. No big deal. It was just one day. The show must go on. And things were fine for a day or so, but on Friday, the same thing happened again. Crazy nighttime urges to eat. And again, I gave in, albeit moderately. I felt guilty for doing so, and was reminded of all the times I have given in before, losing control completely. I felt suddenly vulnerable, no longer the master of myself, prone to being swept along by whatever urges come my way. And I realized I couldn&#8217;t do this right now. I&#8217;m not strong enough.

So Friday night was the end of my &#8220;30-day&#8221; IF trial. I wish I could say I was a super-disciplined, unassailable fortress of will, but I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m a frail, fearful human being. I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of thinking about why this happened, about where my mind was when I started this experiment, about my mental and physical health and what this whole project of weight loss, physique development and health is really about.

And I realized a lot of it is about how much I hated being obese. How I allowed it to limit me, scare me, shame me, hurt me, and nearly kill me. It&#8217;s about how much I despised my body and how desperately I wanted it to change. And how all of this grew into an unhealthy obsessive relationship with diet and exercise. There&#8217;s a constant push in me towards perfection, many times with a myopic disregard for the long-term health consequences for either my psyche or my body.

So I say all of that to say this. I&#8217;m taking a step back. I&#8217;m taking several large, deliberate steps back toward self-compassion. I&#8217;m lightening up on myself. No more calorie deficits for a while. I&#8217;ve even stopped counting calories. I want to love my body and treat it with the respect it deserves. Trying to force my body to change by sheer will and effort reaches a point where it is counter-productive. For me, having been in a caloric deficit for the better part of a year and a half, that point has been reached. It&#8217;s time for love and acceptance now. It&#8217;s time for rest and recuperation. It&#8217;s time to celebrate life and the progress I&#8217;ve made. It&#8217;s time to de-stress and live a little. It&#8217;s time to sigh aÂ deep, long sigh of relief from the overwhelming stress I have created.

And what a sweet relief it is.
