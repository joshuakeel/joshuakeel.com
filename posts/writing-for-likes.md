I used to spend untold hours on Facebook each week. I was heavily involved in Facebook groups, always chatting on Messenger, and much of my social life revolved around people I only knew online. I didn&#8217;t have a lot of friends in the real world. But as I began going out and meeting new people, I lost interest in constantly being online. Not that I stopped caring about any of my online friends, but I realized it was probably better for all of us if we engaged with the outside world more than the online one.

These days, I hardly use Facebook at all, mostly for events and as a contact list. I don&#8217;t browse the News Feed (although I do sometimes get briefly sucked in when I visit), and I don&#8217;t pay too much attention to notifications. There is so much noise in the signal. But one thing I always liked about Facebook is being able to post thought-provoking status updates, and watching the comments and likes come in. I enjoyed interacting with people, having a conversation about what I had said. I felt like I had accomplished something: crafted a thought, made it the best it could be, and sent it out into the world to see what would happen.

But this is a game I soon grew tired of. Writing a status update or a tweet is a poor substitute for really fleshing out an idea. I would congratulate myself for having a cool thought, not realizing that cool thoughts are a dime a dozen. Cool thoughts aren&#8217;t necessarily well-formed or particularly enlightening. It takes hard work to make a cool thought into something worth thinking about.

I realized I was just toying around with myself by writing Facebook status updates and thinking I had pulled off some creative feat. Having a thought and writing it as a status update was just a way to avoid the real work of fully thinking through the idea, considering it from many angles, and understanding what I actually had to say about the issue, not just what sounded cool for 15 seconds.

What I needed was to do the work. The hard work of agonizing over words, of spewing my thoughts onto paper in a first draft—a messy, shitty, first draft—that makes me despair of ever being worthy of a readership. And then crafting that, line by line, into something beautiful and resonant.

So I&#8217;m not writing for the quick win anymore. I&#8217;m not writing for likes. I&#8217;m writing to express myself well and deeply and thoughtfully, and I&#8217;m writing to create something meaningful in the world, something valuable and extraordinary. I&#8217;m under no illusions that this path is easy, but I trust it will be worth it. Will you join me?
