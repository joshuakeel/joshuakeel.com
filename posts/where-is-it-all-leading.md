Your life, your story—all the experiences and struggles and triumphs that you’ve seen—it has all led to now. Where is now? Where is it all going? Who will you be able to serve because of the things you’ve learned, the people you’ve met, the challenges you’ve overcome?

This is what I ask myself all the time. I can’t see the end result. I can’t see the big picture. I feel like I’m 75% of the way through a long, dark tunnel, and when I come out the other side, much will be seen about why I was in that tunnel, and where I am now.

I obsess about nutrition, strength training, finding peace and happiness, learning how to be a better partner, etc. For years I’ve been putting together puzzle pieces, but the puzzle still isn’t complete.

In the meantime, I just keep looking for where the next piece goes. Rinse and repeat. Sometimes we don’t know where our lives are headed. We don’t really need to. We only need to understand the current scene. No stress.

As [Constructive Living][1] would say, “What needs doing now?”

Find out. Go do it. Keep your chin up.
